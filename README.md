### go-realtime

Keep your Go structs in sync with your JS objects

:warning: This project is in beta and the API may change

### Features

* Simple API
* Works with any JSON marshallable struct
* Delta updates using JSONPatch

### Quick Usage

Server

``` go
type Foo struct {
	realtime.Object
	A, B int
}
foo := &Foo{}

//create handler and add foo
rt := realtime.NewHandler()
rt.Add("foo", foo)

//serve websockets and realtime.js client library 
http.Handle("/realtime", rt)

//...later...

//make changes
foo.A = 42
//push to client
foo.Update()
```

Client

``` js
var foo = {};

var rt = realtime("/realtime");

rt.add("foo", foo, function onupdate() {
	//do stuff with foo...
});
```

### Example

See [example](example/) which is running live here https://go-realtime-demo.herokuapp.com/

### Notes

* Object synchronization is currently one way (server to client) only.
* Client object properties beginning with `$` will be ignored.
